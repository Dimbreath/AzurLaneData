# AzurLaneData

Note: As of version 5.x.x.x of the game, encryption has changed yet again for all servers (not only Japan like before) not only that, but they also modified the lua files themselves that are inside the scripts bundle, so it will be a while until the repository is back up. (Someone please fix for me I'm tired of this shit.)

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client.

Updates should be pushed here within a few minutes. If it missed an update please let me know so I can fix it.
