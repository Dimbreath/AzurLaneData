# AzurLaneData

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client.

Updates should be pushed here within a few minutes. If it missed an update please let me know so I can fix it.

**NOTE:** For those wanting to see the upcoming event patch data, will have to wait for a few hours since I didn't re-write the scripts to automatically push updates with their changes. I'm lazy, let me be. *comfyemote*
