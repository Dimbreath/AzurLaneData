# AzurLaneScripts

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client.

Updates should be pushed here within a few minutes. If it missed an update please let me know so I can fix it. ~~Which will probably happen since ugly code.~~

For any issues with the repository itself (i.e. it missed an update or it stopped updating a client (most likely they changed the encryption method on that server to the one Japan client is using) let me known on Dimbreath#0424.
