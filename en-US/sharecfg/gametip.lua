Temporary Recruit Info:

About Temporary Recruits:
1. A Temporary Recruit is a ship that joins your fleet for the duration of an event.
2. If you haven't Formally Recruited the ship by the time the event ends, they will leave your fleet. 
3. Any resources you've spent on them through Limit Breaks or Enhancing will not be refunded if this happens.

About Formally Recruiting:
 Once you've accumulated enough Friendship Points (FP) with the Temporary Recruit and collected all the rewards from the event banner, you can upgrade their status to Formally Recruited and they will permanently join your fleet.

Temporary Recruit Restrictions:
1. There are certain restrictions on what you can and can't do with a Temporary Recruit until they've been Formally Recruited.
2. What you can do:
 - Add and remove them from Formations (except for Exercises)
 - Send them into battle
 - Enhance them
 - Limit Break them
3. What you can't do:
 - Retire them
 - Use them as Enhancing Material
 - Use them as Limit Break material
 - Send them on commissions
 - Make an Oath with them
 - Cognitively Awaken them
 - Set them as your Secretary
 - Add them to a Lecture]]

Supply Line Disruption
1. Supply Line Disruption is available every day of the week.
2. During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.
3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.
4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.
5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.
6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.
7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied
8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.
9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.
10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.

Tips:
1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!
2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.
3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.
4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.
5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.
6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.

Escort Cargo is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.

Maritime Attack is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

Fierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Tactical Training is available every day of the week.

About Attack/Support Range:
- The Flagship of the Submarine Fleet determines the whole Submarine Fleet's Attack/Support Range (ASR.)

- The Submarine Fleet can move on their own and attack enemies within their range, lowering the enemy's combat strength.

- Tapping the "Submarine Support" button when in combat with an enemy within the Submarine Fleet's range will summon your Submarine Fleet to assist you in battle.

- Submarines will only use Ammunition when attacking enemies on their own. When summoned in a battle, they will both use Ammunition and consume Oil.

- The Submarine Fleet has 2 settings: Support Mode (the fleet will be on standby) and Attack Mode (the fleet will attack enemies automatically.)
- This setting can be changed at any time from the Formation menu on the right side of the screen when sortieing.

Attack/Support Range Level:
- The higher the ASR level the Submarine Fleet's Flagship is, the further from their starting location they can attack or provide support.

- You can increase the ASR level through Limit Breaking your Submarines, leveling certain skills, and equipping them with certain gear.]]

Lecture Hall Information

When you put Students in the Lecture Hall, they can partake in a Lecture which converts the fleet's accumulated Proficiency into EXP.

- About Proficiency
A set amount of the EXP earned by Level 100 or higher ships will be automatically added to the Lecture Hall in the form of Proficiency.
Proficiency is shared among the whole fleet and you cannot accumulate more than the Lecture Hall can hold.
Upgrading the Lecture Hall will increase the cap of how much Proficiency you can accumulate as well as increase the amount of Proficiency earned.

- About Lectures
The types of ships you can send to study in the Lecture Hall depends on the day of the week.
Once you have begun a Lecture, you can end it at any time you wish.
Ending the Lecture will convert Proficiency to EXP for the Students depending on how long the Lecture lasted.
The maximum amount of time a Lecture can last is 12 hours.
Up to the point before the Lecture finishes, the acquired Proficiency will be automatically converted into EXP for the Students in attendance.

- About Students
Only ships below Level 100 can be added the Lecture Hall.
The more Students you add, the more efficient the conversion rate of Proficiency to EXP will be.
Students will lose a small amount of Morale when participating in a Lecture.
Monitors can partake in Battleship Lectures.
Repair Ships can partake in Destroyer and Cruiser Lectures.
Aviation Battleships can partake in Carrier and Battleship Lectures.

- Lecture Schedule
Monday: Destroyers - Amazon's Amazing Torpedo Tactics!
Tuesday: Cruisers - The Right Ammo for The Right Time
Wednesday: Battleships - Why The "Bigger Gun Principle" Works
Thursday: Carriers - Positioning Out on The Open Ocean
Friday: Destroyers - Tactics Even a Monkey Could Understand!
Saturday: Cruisers - How To Maximize Your Firepower

There are no Lectures on Sundays, but you will earn double the amount of Proficiency from sorties.]]

Starting Development

1. You can develop a Priority ship by completing their development requirements.
2. The Priority ship's development requirements are shown on the right side of the screen.
3. You can begin development on a ship by choosing one from the Shipyard screen, then tapping the Begin Development button.
4. You can not develop several ships at once.

Development Missions
1. When you complete all of the development missions for your chosen ship, you will receive the ship.
2. While a ship is being developed, new development missions for her will unlock every 24 hours.
3. By completing these missions, the ship's development will progress.
4. The first development mission will be unlocked as soon as you begin developing the ship.
5. A few development missions require you to complete previous ones before you can continue.

Changing The Ship in Development
1. While developing a ship, you can choose to start developing another instead.
2. When you change which ship you are developing, your progress on the ship you had been working on will be saved.
3. Once you start or resume development, you can not change which ship to develop for 24 hours.

Completing Development
1. When you complete all of the development missions for your chosen ship, you will receive the ship and unlock the ability to enhance it.
2. Once you've finished development, you must manually choose a new ship to develop.

Enhancing Priority Ships
1. Once you acquire a Priority ship, you unlock the ability to enhance it.
2. To enhance a Priority ship, you need to spend PR Blueprints on it.
3. You can acquire PR Blueprints by conducting research in the Tech Academy.
4. By enhancing your Priority ship, you can increase their stats.
5. At regular Dev. Level intervals, they will also acquire even more stats and abilities.

About Level Caps for Priority Ships:
You do not need to Limit Break a Priority ship to get them to Level 100, but in order to increase their Level Cap, you must induce a Cognitive Awakening in them by spending Cognitive Chips and Coins.]]

About Distress Signals:
- You can receive Distress Signals at random from any Chapter on the world map.Even when you're logged out, you can still receive Distress Signals.
- You must first clear the final stage (X-4) of a Chapter before you can receive Distress Signals from it.

About The Find Source Button:
- When you tap this button, you will locate which Chapter the Distress Signal is coming from.
- Once you've located the signal's source, you can initiate a Rescue Mission.
- You can only have 1 Rescue Mission active per Chapter. You must complete the Rescue Mission or let its timer run out before you can get another Rescue Mission for the same Chapter.
- A Rescue Mission will disappear once you've cleared it or 12 hours have passed.

Signal Sensitivity:
- Your Signal Sensitivity dictates which Chapters you may receive Distress Signals from.
- At Sensitivity level 1, Rescue Missions will only appear in Chapter 3.
- As you increase your Signal Sensitivity level, you will gain access to Rescue Missions in higher Chapters on the world map.
- You can increase your Signal Sensitivity by 1 level by S-Ranking the Boss Node on your currently highest level available Rescue Mission. Your Signal Sensitivity caps out at level 8.
- Additionally, the higher your Sensitivity level, the better the rewards you may receive from clearing the Boss Node.

Combat Details:
- You will encounter enemy Submarines during Rescue Missions. Before you attempt a Rescue Mission, it's recommended that you first equip your DDs and CLs with Anti-Sub gear.

<color=#92fc63>- About the Event Stage:</color>
1. The Event Stage can be played on 4 difficulty modes: <color=#92fc63>Easy</color>, <color=#92fc63>Normal</color>, <color=#92fc63>Hard</color>, and <color=#92fc63>EX</color>.
2. You earn a <color=#92fc63>fixed amount</color> of CP from the first 3 difficulties, but the amount of CP and which rewards you receive on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color> are based on how much damage you dealt during the battle.
3. The Event Stage uses a <color=#92fc63>different fleet composition</color> to regular maps. You can change its formation beforehand.
4. <color=#92fc63>Oil</color> will be consumed when you sortie for and win on the Event Stage. When you complete the map, you receive <color=#92fc63>EXP</color> and <color=#92fc63>clear rewards</color> as per usual, and Morale changes will take effect. (Note that the EX difficulty also imposes a <color=#92fc63>60-second time limit</color>. Your EX difficulty run concludes when you run out of time, when you defeat the boss, or when your Flagship sinks.)
5. You can deploy <color=#92fc63>submarines</color> and <color=#92fc63>Meowfficers</color> on EX difficulty. Calling in your submarines during a battle will cost Oil.
6. You can play on Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty <color=#92fc63>as much as you like</color>, but you will need to spend a <color=#92fc63>Bonus Ticket</color> each time you wish to do a run on <color=#92fc63>EX difficulty</color>.

1. Your first <color=#92fc63>15 battles</color> on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty of each day are treated as <color=#92fc63>Reward Sorties</color>, which will give you better clear rewards than usual.
2. If you've <color=#92fc63>used up</color> your 15 daily Reward Sorties, you can use <color=#92fc63>Bonus Tickets</color> to gain access to more Reward Sorties.
3. <color=#92fc63>Bonus Tickets</color> are also used to gain access to EX difficulty.

<color=#ff5c5c>- Miscellaneous Info:</color>
1. If you abort an EX difficulty run halfway through, your Bonus Ticket will still be consumed, but you will <color=#ff5c5c>not receive any rewards or CP</color>.
2. We recommend you play the game on <color=#92fc63>Manual Mode</color> when doing a run on EX difficulty.
3. A Reward Sortie will <color=#92fc63>not be deducted from your daily 15</color> if you choose to abort a run halfway through on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty.
4. We urge you to keep an eye on your ships' Morale and Affinity and to not sortie too much. <color=#92fc63>Please be considerate!</color>
5. The number of clears required for any given server to complete the event will differ based on the combined user data of that server.]]

Regarding Airspace Control:
Airspace Control Value (ACV) is a modifier that affects aerial combat. Each stage has its own ACV, which is then compared against your ACV to establish which side has Airspace Control, and to what extent.

Your Airspace Control status affects the following:
1. How much damage your fleets' Airstrikes deal
2. How much damage your fleets take from enemy aircraft
3. The Accuracy, Evasion, and Recon Value of your fleets (to a small degree)

When your ACV is lower than that of the stage's, you will lose control over the airspace, which impacts your fleets negatively.
You can check your Airspace Control status by tapping on its icon, located near the top left side of the screen when in a sortie.

Airspace Control Value Calculation:
The following factors are used to calculate your ACV:
1. The number of plane-carrying ships in your fleets when sortieing (specifically: CVs, CVLs, BBVs, and SSVs)
2. The combined Aviation stat of your fleets
3. The types and number of aircraft your plane-carrying ships have (Fighters, Bombers, Torpedo Bombers, and Seaplanes)
Your current ACV can be found on the sortie screen before entering a stage. If your ACV is lower than the recommended value, you may want to make changes to your fleet formation to increase it.

The following factors determine how high the stage's ACV is:
1. The chapter and subchapter (the later the stage, the higher the ACV will generally be)
2. The combined Anti-Air stat of your fleets
3. For Hard Mode stages: whether or not you have unlocked and enabled Clearing Mode on that particular stage

- General Tips:
1. When one of your ships sink, whatever stats they contributed to your ACV will be ignored, and your ACV will decrease accordingly.
2. Of the 4 types of aircraft, Fighters contribute the most to your ACV. Dive Bombers contribute the second most, followed by Torpedo Bombers, then Seaplanes. If you want to significantly increase your ACV, sortie with CVs that have a lot of Fighters.
3. Even a fleet that is not actively in combat with an enemy node still contributes to your ACV.]]

Evasion Cap Details:

<color=#92fc63>Tech Mechanics:</color>
1. The Tech Mechanics give stat buffs to your entire fleet.
2. You unlock these buffs by collecting and getting your ships to a high level.
3. <color=#92fc63>The buffs apply to ships which have been fully Limit Broken.</color>
4. In essence, you will gain the most benefits by leveling all the ships you have in your Dock.

The Tech Mechanics can be separated into two distinct types: Fleet Tech and Faction Tech.

Fleet Tech:
1. The Fleet Tech mechanic grants buffs, which are unlocked by leveling your ships, to your entire fleet. 
2. You can view your collection and Tech acquisition statuses on the Fleet Tech screen.
3. The ships are sorted into tiers based on their historical technology development order.
4. When you complete the following achievements with a ship, your entire fleet will receive the corresponding stat buff(s) associated with her group:
 - <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> the ship in your Library - Getting the ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
5. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive buffs from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.

<color=#92fc63>Faction Tech</color>:
1. Faction Tech is a mechanic that gives stat buffs to your entire fleet based on your Tech Level with each faction.
2. You can view a faction's Tech Level and the buffs it gives to your fleet by tapping its corresponding tab on the Faction Tech screen.
3. By increasing a faction's Tech Level, you can further increase the buffs that it gives.
4. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you must spend <color=#92fc63>Coins</color> and meet the Tech Point requirement for that faction.
5. Lastly, you can only increase the Tech level of one faction at a time.

About Tech Points:
1. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you need to have collected a certain amount of Tech Points from ships of that faction. 
2. From the Faction Tech screen, you can view how many Tech Points you have with each faction.
3. You can acquire Tech Points through the following means:
- <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> a new ship in your Library- <color=#92fc63>Fully Limit Breaking</color> a ship- Getting a ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>
4. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive Tech Points from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.]]

Event Information: 

1. This event and the rewards you can receive from it are split into 2 categories depending on your last login status: 
 a. Active Commander 
 b. Returning/New Commander
2. Players who meet the following criterion are categorized as Active Commanders and are eligible for Active Commander objectives and rewards: 
- Logged in at least once at any point between August 11th, 2019 and before the maintenance on September 11th, 2019.
3. Players who do not meet this criterion are categorized as Returning/New Commanders and are eligible for their own set of objectives and rewards.
4. If you are unsure whether you are an Active Commander or a Returning/New Commander, please view the information in the Returnee Missions banner. 
5. An Active Commander's objective is to receive Returnee Points from up to 2 other players who participate in and complete Returnee Missions. Once an Active Commander has collected enough points, they can claim various nice rewards from the event banner.
6. Returning/New Commanders can participate in Returnee Missions by entering the UID of an Active Commander into the event banner on their end. You can see the UIDs of your linked Returning/New Commanders on the right side of the event banner. 
7. Active Commanders can tap the "Send Mobilization Request" button to show their UID to Returning/New Commanders who are looking for Active Commander UIDs.
8. A Returning/New Commander's objective is to enter an Active Commander's UID in the event banner to gain access to Returnee Missions. Returning/New Commanders who participate in Returnee Missions gain access to daily tasks which give various nice rewards when completed.

- If you get a good high score during the period this feature is available, you'll be rewarded with a special Portrait to decorate your player profile with.
- The Challenge Stage lineup will be restructured randomly every Monday at 00:00 throughout the period this feature is available.

Making a Donation when you have no Visits will still consume resources but grant no blessing effects.</color></size>
1. Earn Shrine Visits by using Game Tickets to play any of the three minigames.
2. As long as you have Shrine Visits, you can make a Donation of 5 coins to choose one of these blessings: Academic Achievement: reduces training time in the Tactical Class. Career Success: Deal more damage while sortieing in a Campaign, Hard Mode, or War Archives map.Blissful Courtship: Your secretary gains affection faster.These blessings last for one day.
3. Gaining the Academic Achievement blessing will not reduce the time of any in-progress training.When the blessing expires, it will also not increase the time of any in-progress training.
4. If you acquire a new blessing while one is already in effect, the new blessing will replace the existing one and reset the duration.
5. Only one blessing may be active at a time.]]

<color=#FFDD00>Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019</color>

About the Popularity Poll:
 The Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 consists of two parts: in-game voting, and website voting. The Poll has 3 main rounds: Qualifiers, Groups, and Finals. 
 For each step of voting, the candidates that advance to the next step are determined by the combined totals of in-game voting across all servers, and website voting.

Popularity Poll Rules:
 Qualifiers round:
 All characters, excluding Hall of Fame characters, that were implemented prior to 8/29/2019 are in the Qualifiers, meaning a total of 298 characters. The top 150 characters with the most votes advance to the Groups round.
 The Qualifiers round will be hosted in-game only.
 Note: during the Qualifiers round, a character's number of votes will not be displayed, only their ranking.
 Qualifiers Comeback round:
 Characters that lost the Qualifiers enter a separate vote. The top 10 characters from this vote get the chance to appear in the Finals Comeback round.
 The Qualifiers Comeback round will be hosted on a special webpage only.
 Groups round:
 Characters that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 30 ships per group. Each character competes for votes within their own group. The top 3 characters with the most votes within each group advances to the Finals while the top 4 to 10 characters from each group are sent to the Finals Comeback round.
 Finals Comeback round:
 The top 4 to 10 characters of each group and the top 10 from the Qualifiers Comeback will participate in this separate vote. The top 9 characters who receive the most votes will advance to the Finals.
 Finals round:
 The Finals consist of 15 characters from the Groups round and 9 from the Finals Comeback round, for a total of 24 characters.
 Final Result Calculation:
 Once each step has concluded, the website votes will be weighted then added to the in-game votes to calculate the final vote count.
 In the event of a tie, the character who reached that number of votes first will advance.

Final Results Announcement:
 Once each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 in-game and on the website.
 Once the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.

How to Vote:
 In-game Voting:
 Players with a Commander level of 25 and above can obtain Ballots through the following 2 ways:
 1: By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.
 2: By sortieing and defeating Boss nodes in Campaign mode to earn a Certificate of Support.
 Players can use their Certificate of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.
 Support Points will in turn give the player Ballots based on how many Points he/she earned.
 The player can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite characters with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.
 Please note that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all remaining Ballots will disappear.

About Certificates of Support:
 1. Players can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)
 2. Players cannot possess more than 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.
 3. When using their Certificate of Support, players will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the player will receive Support Points.
 4. The Certificate of Support will disappear if not used within a certain timespan.
 5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points.
	Chapter 3: 120 Points
	Chapter 4: 150 Points
	Chapter 5: 180 Points
	Chapter 6: 220 Points
	Chapter 7: 270 Points
	Chapter 8: 350 Points
	Chapter 9: 450 Points
	Chapter 10: 550 Points
	Chapter 11: 700 Points
	Chapter 12: 850 Points

You can check the in-game Help button for more details on the above.

Website Voting:
 Players can vote on their favorite characters once a day by visiting the Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 website after binding their Twitter or Facebook account to it.
 Players can vote a second time by using the Share button to post their character choices on Twitter. Please note that you can only vote a maximum of 2 times a day from the same device.
 The link to the Popularity Poll website will be posted on the official Azur Lane Twitter and Facebook accounts.

- Summary:
During this event, you can enjoy a handful of minigames and earn Stamps, which can be exchanged for Kinu's skin - "New Year's Blade Demon."

To receive a Stamp, you first need to have a Ticket, which you can get every day by logging in during the event period.

- How to Get Stamps and Tickets You will recieve 1 Ticket a day when you login during the event period.

If you don't login for several days during the event period, you will receive all the Tickets you would have gotten up to that point at the next point you login.

- About the Minigame By tapping the New Year Challenge button, you'll be taken to another screen where you can play Kinu's New Year Training.

When you clear this minigame while in possession of a Ticket, you'll receive 1 Stamp as well as 2 Prayers at the Shrine.

Once you've collected 7 Stamps, you can tap the Check In button on the right to exchange them for Kinu's skin.

Once you've made 7 Prayers at the Shrine, you can claim the New Year's Invitation (2019) from the corresponding event banner.

Note: While you can still play the minigame without a Ticket, you will not receive any rewards from it if you do so.
You may also quit the minigame at any time without losing a Ticket, but you will not receive rewards from it either.]]

<size=31><color=#92fc63>TIPS: 
Tapping the prayer button without any Shrine Visits will still consume coins, but will not grant any blessing.</color></size>

1. Spending tickets to play the fireworks workshop, shooting gallery, or new year's feast minigames will grant Shrine Visits.

2. Tapping the bell rope when you have Shrine Visits will consume 5 coins and grant a blessing.

There are several types of blessings with several different effects:

Education: Reduces the time it takes to train in the Tactical Academy.

Career: Our fleet gets a damage bonus in main story, hard mode, and battle record sorties.

Romance: Your secretary ship gains affection faster.

Blessings remain in effect for one day.

3. An education blessing will not reduce the training time of any lesson in progress when the blessing is activated.

The expiration of the education blessing will not cause any lesson in progress to lengthen.

4. Should you pray for a new blessing when a blessing is already in effect, the new blessing will override the existing one, and its duration will reset.

5. You may only have one active blessing at any one time.]]

- The Manjuu Tower:
The Manjuu Tower is a minigame where your goal is to collect the fallen blocks and stack them as high as you can.
When you finish the game while in possession of a Ticket, 1 Ticket will be deducted and you'll receive a Stamp.
Once you've collected 7 Stamps, you can unlock the Sakura Empire DD through the Spring Festival screen.
You will receive 1 Ticket each day for the duration of the event.

- Minigame Details:
1. Tap on the screen to make blocks fall down from the top of the screen.
2. Make the blocks fall onto the tower to build it and increase your score. Once 3 blocks have fallen and missed the tower, the game ends.
3. The tower has a balance value that must be maintained. If your tower loses too much balance and the Manjuu to the right of the screen reaches the red area, your tower will collapse and the game will end.
4. If you stop the game midway through, you won't lose a Ticket, but you won't receive a Stamp either-
